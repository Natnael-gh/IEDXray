# **IEDXray Dataset and Benchmarking**
This is the official repository for IEDXray dataset hosting finetuned model codes and weights.
## 📁 **Dataset Overview**

The **IEDXray** dataset is a curated and annotated collection of X-ray images designed for the detection and localization of **Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)**. The dataset includes a diverse range of threat types with varying shapes, sizes, materials, and occlusion levels, making it a realistic and challenging benchmark for X-ray object detection. The dataset has multimodal annotations — **image + bounding box + caption** — to be used for downstream training and evaluation.

## 🧪 **Benchmarking Setup**

We perform benchmarking across multiple model architectures to evaluate performance on the IEDXray dataset. Most experiments were conducted using **MMDetection**, leveraging its modular configuration system and strong baseline detectors.
